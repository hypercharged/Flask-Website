            <br>
            <p align="center">Hypercharged was founded in January of 2017 by a bunch of highschool friends
            focusing on something they all loved: cars. The group first began with YouTube videos about car meets they
            attended which can still be found today on YouTube (linked below). But eventually, they expanded to Instagram
            as well. On Instagram they began posting screenshots from videos to gain more traffic to their videos
            but eventually branched out from just videos to photography too. Now, Hypercharged has over 5 team members
            with a focus on photography and videography. We hope you join us for our crazy ride as we continue to
            expand and do some crazy cool projects!</p>
